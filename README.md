A machine learning-powered career prediction web app that helps users determine potential career paths based on their skills, interests, and academic performance.  

🔗 **Live Demo**: [Career Predictor](https://career-predictor.up.railway.app/)  

## 🚀 Features  
- Predicts a career path based on input data (GPA, skills, domain, projects, etc.).  
- Built using Flask as the backend.  
- Utilizes a trained machine learning model for prediction.  
- Responsive and user-friendly UI.  

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model  
The app uses a **Logistic Regression** trained on a dataset containing various student profiles, including GPA, programming skills (Python, Java, SQL), and preferred domains. The model predicts the most suitable career path based on this information.  

- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `scikit-learn` for model training  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data processing  
  - `joblib` for model serialization  

The trained model is loaded in Flask and used to provide predictions based on user input.
